# Technology

## Motivation

- Let new developers get up to speed quickly
- Let developers have a place to note down tips, tricks and caveats
- Let others know what we're using and why

## How

- Add a new file for each technology we use in the project
- Explain what it does, why we use it, how to use it, and how it fits into the stack
